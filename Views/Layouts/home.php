            <h2>World's best Gin - Napue</h2>
            <p>
            The world's best gin comes from Ostrobothnia in Finland, according to the jury of the International Wine & Spirit Competition. 
            Napue Gin, created by Kyrö Distillery in Ostrobothnia, Finland, won first place in the Gin & Tonic category at the International Wine & Spirit Competition organised in the UK.

                Originally drunk medicinally by the army of the British East India Company, is there a cocktail more quintessentially British than a G&T? In a nod to the timeless favourite, The International Wine and Spirit Competition (IWSC) has spent months tasting gins from across the globe, hunting for the gin of all gins to marry with age-old partner, tonic. 
                Having searched far and wide, they’ve now found the winner of their very first G&Tcompetition to bring you the world’s ultimate serve.
                It may be a simple partnership, but there’s nothing simple about the IWSC’s winning gin, Napue. With roots at the very heart of Finnish nature, Napue is a full bodied spirit with a herbal sweet taste and hints of sea-buckthorn, cranberries, pepper, rye and birch leaves.

                

                Perfectly paired with Fever Tree’s Indian Tonic Water, a blend of botanical oils, spring water and the highest quality quinine from the 'fever trees' of the Eastern Congo, the G&T has a uniquely crisp, mellow and refreshing taste and aroma.
